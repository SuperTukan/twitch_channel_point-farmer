# twitch_channel_point-farmer
JavaScript for farming Channel points on Twitch. Not super efficient, but you won't even notice anyway.

Pure JavaScript, works in every browser.

Use with whatever JavaScript injecting methods you want. I use https://addons.mozilla.org/cs/firefox/addon/javascript/, but you can even do without addons at all.
